### Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹ I love you!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on abolishing suffering in the universe at [CrowdsourcingCures.org](https://crowdsourcingcures.org/). 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on abolishing suffering in the universe at our [wiki](https://wiki.crowdsourcingcures.org/). 

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [data collection](https://app.crowdsourcingcures.org/) and [open-source development on our app](https://github.com/crowdsourcing-cures/crowdsourcing-cures-app). 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how you can help us abolish suffering in the universe at https://twitter.com/thinkbynumbers

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: words that can function by themselves as a noun phrase and that refers either to the participants in the discourse
